```


1.  How many rows are in `penguins`?
    How many columns?



2.  What does the `bill_depth_mm` variable in the `penguins` data frame describe?
    Read the help for `?penguins` to find out.



3.  Make a scatterplot of `bill_depth_mm` vs. `bill_length_mm`.
    That is, make a scatterplot with `bill_depth_mm` on the y-axis and `bill_length_mm` on the x-axis.
    Describe the relationship between these two variables.



4.  What happens if you make a scatterplot of `species` vs. `bill_depth_mm`?
    What might be a better choice of geom?



5.  Why does the following give an error and how would you fix it?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point()
```



6.  What does the `na.rm` argument do in `geom_point()`?
    What is the default value of the argument?
    Create a scatterplot where you successfully use this argument set to `TRUE`.




7.  Add the following caption to the plot you made in the previous exercise: "Data come from the palmerpenguins package." Hint: Take a look at the documentation for `labs()`.




8.  Recreate the following visualization.
    What aesthetic should `bill_depth_mm` be mapped to?
    And should it be mapped at the global level or at the geom level?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('Question8.png')
```

9.  Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like.
    Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = island)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```



10. Will these two graphs look different?
    Why/why not?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = penguins,
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = penguins,
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
  )
```



11.  Make a bar plot of `species` of `penguins`, where you assign `species` to the `y` aesthetic.
    How is this plot different?



12.  How are the following two plots different?
    Which aesthetic, `color` or `fill`, is more useful for changing the color of bars?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar(color = "red")

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "red")
```


13.  What does the `bins` argument in `geom_histogram()` do?



14.  Make a histogram of the `carat` variable in the `diamonds` dataset that is available when you load the tidyverse package.
    Experiment with different binwidths.
    What binwidth reveals the most interesting patterns?




15.  The `mpg` data frame that is bundled with the ggplot2 package contains `r nrow(mpg)` observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on `r mpg |> distinct(model) |> nrow()` car models.
    Which variables in `mpg` are categorical?
    Which variables are numerical?
    (Hint: Type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset.) How can you see this information when you run `mpg`?



16.  Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs. `displ` using the `mpg` data frame.
    Next, map a third, numerical variable to `color`, then `size`, then both `color` and `size`, then `shape`.
    How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. numerical variables?




17.  In the scatterplot of `hwy` vs. `displ`, what happens if you map a third variable to `linewidth`?




18.  What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?




19.  Make a scatterplot of `bill_depth_mm` vs. `bill_length_mm` and color the points by `species`.
    What does adding coloring by species reveal about the relationship between these two variables?
    What about faceting by `species`?




20.  Why does the following yield two separate legends?
    How would you fix it to combine the two legends?

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, 
    color = species, shape = species
  )
) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(color = "Species")
```



21.  Create the two following stacked bar plots.
    Which question can you answer with the first one?
    Which question can you answer with the second one?

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill = island)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```



22.  Run the following lines of code.
    Which of the two plots is saved as `mpg-plot.png`?
    Why?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave("mpg-plot.png")
```



23.  What do you need to change in the code above to save the plot as a PDF instead of a PNG?
    How could you find out what types of image files would work in `ggsave()`?
